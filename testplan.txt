This file will describe a list of different commands used to test WTF and WTFServer.  
It will be based off the WTFTest.c file, which runs a set of test cases showing the functionality of this project. First We fork the process to get the pid of the server. 

Next we create 2 directories,(clientTest) and (serverTest), to (make copies of and then store) our client and server C files. Next we compile and run both server and client executables(based on whether the pid is 0 or not)

After this, we run through a series of client commands to the server. The comments inside the source file of WTFTest.c detail each test to a high degree but to put it simply, we test all the functions and output success or failure messages to the client for either success/error cases.

For the entirety of the test, the user is able to see the outputs of the client AND the server.

Overall, there are a total of 31 commands that go over the functionality of all 13 functions programmed. In those 31 commands there are error cases and success cases.

After finishing running the commands for the test, we call a kill command that sends a SIGINT signal to the server. Upon receiving this, the server calls our "Exit_handler" function and terminates all 17 threads in the test execution and sends a "server closed" message.


User Notes:

	- call "make clean" before calling "make test", otherwise the program will prompt 	the user to do so.

	- make clean will remove the executables as well as clientTest and serverTest in 	order to prepare for another "make test" command

	- to run the Test executable, call make test. There is no need to input anything 	else, the Makefile will automatically run the executable in addition to compiling 	WTFTest.c
